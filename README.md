REU QCC 2021

This research was conducted through Queensborough Community College Research Experience for Undergraduate Students 
with the help of co-advisors Dr. Jillian Bellovary and Ray Sharma. My work focused on studying the effects that 
intermediate mass black holes may have on sixteen dwarf galaxies from the ROMULUS simulation. I created various 
gas property maps which include density, temperature, and velocity some of which had black holes, some without, 
even some with multiple black holes that were centered and off-centered, all of which can be found in this repository.

Special thanks to Dr. David Lieberman and Dr. Kimberly Riegel for allowing me to participate in this program.
